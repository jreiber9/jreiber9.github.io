        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>myFlix is a dynamic web application
            crafted with the MERN stack,
            designed to offer users an
            immersive movie experience.
            Seamlessly blending movies,
            directors, and genres, myFlix
            empowers users to create
            personalized accounts, manage
            personal information, and curate a
            collection of beloved movies.</p>

            <h3>Purpose</h3>
            <p>
                I created myFlix during my full-stack web development course at
                CareerFoundry to showcase my skills in JavaScript. It's a project
                that demonstrates my ability to build complete web applications
                from start to finish.</p>

            <h3>Objective</h3>
            <p>
                Objective
                To create a robust full-stack
                application to enhance my
                professional portfolio. I aimed to
                tackle the challenge of building
                both the server-side and client-
                side components of the
                application entirely from scratch.
            </p>

                alt="MyFlix Project Snapshot"

                />
              </div>


            <h3>Duration</h3>
            <p>
                myFlix was the biggest project I had undertaken to date, and it was also my first
                time building both the server and client-side. Developing it was quite
                challenging, and I encountered several API integration errors, but
                troubleshooting these helped me improve my debugging skills significantly.
            </p>

            <h3>Credits</h3>
            <p>
                Lead Developer - Josh Reiber(Me)
                Tutor- Jubril Akolade
                Mentor- Jonatan Caraballo
            </p>

            <h3>Methodologies</h3>
            <p>
                MERN stack- MongoDB, Express,
                React, and Node.js
            </p>

            <h3>Server-Side</h3>
            <p>
                I built a RESTful API with Node.js and Express as part of our
                MERN stack setup. This API communicates with a MongoDB
                database, offering straightforward data handling through
                common HTTP methods like GET and POST. CRUD operations
                enable smooth data management. Users can easily access
                movie information in JSON format, streamlining the process for
                a seamless experience.
            </p>

            <h3>Client-Side</h3>
            <p>

                When transitioning from backend development to the client side, my
                focus turned to crafting the user interface that seamlessly interacts
                with the server-side functionality. Leveraging React, I engineered a
                dynamic single-page application that adapts to various devices. This
                involved designing an array of views, each serving a distinct purpose:
                from the main view showcasing an extensive movie catalog to the
                detailed single movie view, empowering users to manage their
                favorite movies effortlessly. Using React's JSX syntax and Bootstrap, I
                ensured a sleek and intuitive user experience. To streamline the
                development workflow, I opted for Parcel as the build tool,
                enhancing efficiency and project organization. Upon completion, I
                deployed the application seamlessly using Netlify, ensuring smooth
                and reliable access for users.

              </div>
              
            <h3>Retrospective</h3>
            <p>
                
                Creating this app taught me a lot about the typical structures and
                technologies used in similar projects. I found organizing the tech stack
                to be very satisfying. I also realized I love working on the backend,
                especially setting up databases. Moving forward, I want to improve my
                skills in designing apps from the start to make them visually appealing.
                I'm excited to work on more projects using React, which has been a
                highlight of my coding journey.
